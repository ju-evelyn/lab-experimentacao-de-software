Adding testing feature to bonfire,39,5049,4,3,"I have created an addition to the bonfire IDE that allows users to test any function within the main coding window.  Here are some pieces of its functionality:
- Identifies arguments and creates input boxes for each
- Side by side mode with editor
- Test suite execution displays percentage of tests correct, highlights passing tests green, failing tests red
- For failing tests, displays what the actual output was
- Users can delete tests once they are created

Here are some todos that still remain:
- Don't use the eval method to evaluate the test. Nate has the plugin, but it is currently only configured with the console output.  I need to make the test framework work as a callback from the plugin completing its execution.  This requires changing a large portion of Nate's code, so I held off on it.
- Allow other types of comparisons besides equality.  We can test behavior, type, length, features of a JSON object, almost anything with chai.

On story submission create unique story URL if slug already exists,291,42,33,1,"#283

Also changed Story.find to Story.findOne because if you clicked on a link like ""/stories/google"" and there was a ""/stories/google-1"" in the database Story.find would return both and end up sending the user to ""/stories/google"" then ""/stories/google-1"". The user would just see ""/stories/google-1"" since it happens so fast but you can see it in the cli.

Since only 1 result should be returned anyway (`exports.returnIndividualStory`), I figured using findOne would be appropriate.

Quick question: What Is the reason for find using regex on the Story.find?:
 `Story.find({'storyLink' : new RegExp(storyName, 'i')}, function(err, story) {`

Issue #277 Fix- coursewares chai-jquery test issue,298,11,11,1,"Should address #277 : The tests were not catching correct color attrs for the CSS challenges.

It's also very picky and does want the spaces after the commas - rgb(255,0,0) does not work. (The docs used to say that you can use strings/hex; they have since been corrected.)

After a cursory glance, this was the only similar occurrence in any of the HTML/CSS Waypoints. Changing expect statemtens to assert statments in the bonfires just seemed to mess up the entire thing, and I've found them helpful, so I assume they shouldn't be replaced all over?

The problem seems to be in the test. If you add the name trait to a checkbox then the challenge will pass. So to fix this I just changed the input type from a checkbox to a radio (which is what the instructions tell you to do it on) and I changed the attribute comparison from trait to personality (which is what the instructions tell you to name it).

I've tested this with console.log and my update works for me. Please review and let me know.

"Some ""Slack to Gitter"" edits",1096,19,19,2,"Don't pull this yet. I split this up into two commits to make it easier to discuss. I was pretty much 100% about the edits in 77d4aff; I went ahead and changed 'in' to 'on' because it sounded better in my head and people in the chat seemed to agree.

In f8fa6ee I just added Gitter as an alternative to Slack because Gitter works closely with GitHub and I wasn't sure whether the non-profits use GitHub or not.

Since my Spanish is not what it should be, I only replaced the links, leaving a native Spanish speaker to reword the sentences in `seed/challenges/get-set-for-free-code-camp.json`.

Lastly, I found a JSON key on line 129 in `common/models/user.json` called `sentSlackInvite`. I'm not sure what this does, couldn't find a reference anywhere else, so I didn't dare to remove it.

Before (and if) you pull this I'd like to rebase it into a single commit, and, if someone explains the Spanish and `sentSlackInvite` parts, add those changes.

Tidying the stylesheets,1234,91,335,9,"...and some related stuff.

I'm not even sure what I was doing anymore, but I stumbled upon an unused CSS selector, decided to look for more, and found quite a few. I'm honsetly not sure if these are somehow used through some sort of magic, but I searched through the entire codebase and found no other references to them, so they should be safe to remove.

Other than remove unused selectors, I organized some of them, fixed the stylization of a few, replaced one, as well as replaced the ubiqitous `#eee` with the already existing `@gray-lighter` variable.

This should hopefully clear the CSS/LESS up a bit, but don't just trust me, get in there and read (specifically the `next-challenge-button` and `delay-half` parts, they confused me) ; I did my best to make sure I'm not deleting some classes, essential to FCC's design, but I'm not making any promises.

add perl5 to backend map,91,1,1,1,"Perl5 is not exactly trendy, but there is still a metric tonne of it around, and will be for the forseeable.  It can be the source of fun and rewarding jobs (it's in the top 10 employable languages, and good perl skills are among the best paid in the industry).  As it's very similar to python, php7 and ruby[1] I figured I would provide a roadmap for perl on the backend diagram too.

What is missing is that because perl's OO is much more flexible than python's[2] (upon which it is based) there are three distinct widely practised ways of doing OO - built in (via blessing references by hand), Moo (lightweight, declarative, emphasis on gradual typing, readability and extensibility) and Moose (compatible with Moo but full blown metaobject model).  I omitted it because OO is not mentioned for the other languages, and space is pretty limited as is.

[1] All these loosely typed dynamic languages are basically the same  with small philosophical and syntatic differences around the edges
[2] And of course therefore gives the unwary interesting ways of shooting themselves in the foot.  For example,  I've seen people who are used to ruby doing really impressive but misguided things with Moose.",1,2,2017-03-28T10:47:13Z,2017-04-01T17:05:52Z,,1204,4 days 06:18:39

"Only measure ""base"" times within ProfileMode",12821,28,5,2,"Follow up for [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12745/files#r186276940) on PR #12745. Previously I was tracking base time for all fibers, regardless of whether they were inside of a `Profiler`, because the place where I started the timer didn't yet know if it was in a `ProfileMode`.

I could move where I start/stop the timer somewhere else- where it would know- but this approach seemed simpler. It has a small potential downside of not measuring ""base"" time for the `Profiler` component itself- but I think this is okay because (1) that time should be minimal and (2) it isn't really actionable for a developer.

### Questions
* ~~Should I remove the conditionals around `stopBaseRenderTimerIfRunning`? (Is it worth having them?)~~

* We pause/resume the global render timer even outside of a `ProfileMode` tree. This only updates a single numeric value though; it doesn't modify any attributes on a fiber.",0,3,2018-05-15T17:39:49Z,2018-05-15T19:43:43Z,2018-05-15T19:43:43Z,949,0 days 02:03:54

Don't try to read child nodes of Text when hydrating,12829,2,1,1,"Text nodes can't have children. Flow didn't catch this for some reason, but it does in my WIP branch where I run Flow with more specific types.

This doesn't really change the behavior except getting rid of an unnecessary function call and a read from a DOM node. The issue is unobservable but it breaks typing in my future PR.

[WIP] API for async-safe access of mutable data,12835,249,5,5,"Opening this early so I can get feedback on the overall approach.

Call `willAccessMutableState` whenever a React component reads from a mutable data source. This includes inside a change event handler (right before calling `setState`) and in a constructor when reading the component's initial state.

React keeps track of the the lowest priority update that is the result of a mutable state change.

If a component attempts to read from mutable state during the render phase at a higher priority than the lowest priority mutation update, React will suspend the high priority work and coalesce it with the low priority render, to prevent tearing.

Unresolved questions:

- This is modeled like a suspend on asynchronous data. The difference is that this should never trigger a placeholder, since the data needed to complete the render is available, just at a lower priority. Because of this, the high priority work is effectively deprioritized. I think an alternative, possibly better, approach would be to increase the priority of the low priority work. I'm not sure yet how we'd implement this, though, since the only other case where we upgrade the priority of pending work is `batch.commit()`, and in that case the work is flushed synchronously.
- For the initial mount, this strategy requires components to subscribe to the data source during the render phase. This cuts against our current recommendation to subscribe in `componentDidMount`.
- Whatever strategy we choose here, we should update `create-subscription` to follow it.",5,5,2018-05-16T22:28:01Z,2018-05-31T22:25:09Z,,1548,14 days 23:57:08
Temporary fix for grabbing wrong rAF polyfill in ReactScheduler,12837,52,16,4,"**what is the change?:**
For now...
We need to grab a slightly different implementation of rAF internally at
FB than in Open Source. Making rAF a dependency of the ReactScheduler
module allows us to fork the dependency at FB.

NOTE: After this lands we have an alternative plan to make this module
separate from React and require it before our Facebook timer polyfills
are applied. But want to land this now to keep master in a working state
and fix bugs folks are seeing at Facebook. This is basically the same as previously closed PR https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12831

If you forget to specify the one you need during local development, `yarn flow` will prompt you to do so. It should be possible to even run them in parallel although I’d expect it to be super slow so in practice you’ll probably use one at a time.

The typechecks are currently exactly the same between renderers. This is a preparation for https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12792 which will shim the host config types for each renderer separately.

The `yarn flow-ci` command that runs on the CI is changed to run Flow with each renderer, one by one.

"Pass ""start time"" and ""commit time"" to Profiler callback",12852,229,96,5,"`Profiler` component passes additional ""start time"" and ""commit time"" parameters to `onRender` callback.

After discussing this new component type with some teams at FB that might use it, it's become apparent that the addition of these time values would be helpful.
* Start time provides a method of determining whether a given commit had already begun when an event took place (e.g. user interaction, Flux action).
* Commit time could be roughly determined using e.g. `performance.now()` within the `onRender` callback, but multiple `Profiler` components would end up with slightly different times for a single commit. This explicit time value ensures consistency.

Tests have been updated to cover both new parameters.

### Caveats

Start time _is not the time_ when the event that triggered a render occurred (e.g. mouse click, Flux update). It is the time when the `Profiler` in question started rendering as a result. (This might be significantly later than the event that originated the update. State updates can be async. Other code may execute in between. etc.)

Commit time is not necessarily the exact time a user sees e.g. the updated DOM. It is the time when React commits the mutations to the DOM- but other scripts may run before the browser repaints.",4,4,2018-05-18T00:52:35Z,2018-05-21T16:49:23Z,2018-05-21T16:49:23Z,1277,3 days 15:56:48

Fix a regression that caused us to listen to extra events at the top,12878,200,22,3,"I think this should fix the regression introduced in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12629 and that @sophiebits has patched over in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12877.

The first three commits are small refactors (I can remove them but I found the final form easier to read with these changes). The last one fixes the logic.

I'll need to work on some way to test this and verify it’s correct. Here’s the methodology with which I arrived at this solution:

1. Take a list of [all DOM event types in master](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/events/DOMTopLevelEventTypes.js)

2. For each type, record whether it exists [in either of two mappings that were deleted in #12629](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1047980dca0830cd55e1622f3fbefc38aeaadb91/packages/react-dom/src/events/BrowserEventConstants.js): `topLevelTypes` or `mediaEventTypes`. Some types were new in master (pointer events) which I treat as if they were in `topLevelTypes`.

After doing this categorization, I ended up with four lists:

### NOT top AND NOT media

* `TOP_INVALID`
* `TOP_RESET`
* `TOP_SUBMIT`

### NOT top AND media

* `TOP_ABORT`
* `TOP_CAN_PLAY`
* `TOP_CAN_PLAY_THROUGH`
* `TOP_DURATION_CHANGE`
* `TOP_EMPTIED`
* `TOP_ENCRYPTED`
* `TOP_ENDED`
* `TOP_ERROR`
* `TOP_LOADED_DATA`
* `TOP_LOADED_METADATA`
* `TOP_PAUSE`
* `TOP_PLAY`
* `TOP_PLAYING`
* `TOP_PROGRESS`
* `TOP_RATE_CHANGE`
* `TOP_SEEKED`
* `TOP_SEEKING`
* `TOP_STALLED`
* `TOP_SUSPEND`
* `TOP_TIME_UPDATE`
* `TOP_VOLUME_CHANGE`
* `TOP_WAITING`

### top AND media

* `TOP_LOAD_START`

### top AND NOT media

* `TOP_ANIMATION_END`
* `TOP_ANIMATION_ITERATION`
* `TOP_ANIMATION_START`
* `TOP_BLUR`
* `TOP_CANCEL`
* `TOP_CHANGE`
* `TOP_CLICK`
* `TOP_CLOSE`
* `TOP_COMPOSITION_END`
* `TOP_COMPOSITION_START`
* `TOP_COMPOSITION_UPDATE`
* `TOP_CONTEXT_MENU`
* `TOP_COPY`
* `TOP_CUT`
* `TOP_DOUBLE_CLICK`
* `TOP_DRAG`
* `TOP_DRAG_END`
* `TOP_DRAG_ENTER`
* `TOP_DRAG_EXIT`
* `TOP_DRAG_LEAVE`
* `TOP_DRAG_OVER`
* `TOP_DRAG_START`
* `TOP_DROP`
* `TOP_FOCUS`
* `TOP_GOT_POINTER_CAPTURE`
* `TOP_INPUT`
* `TOP_KEY_DOWN`
* `TOP_KEY_PRESS`
* `TOP_KEY_UP`
* `TOP_LOAD`
* `TOP_LOST_POINTER_CAPTURE`
* `TOP_MOUSE_DOWN`
* `TOP_MOUSE_MOVE`
* `TOP_MOUSE_OUT`
* `TOP_MOUSE_OVER`
* `TOP_MOUSE_UP`
* `TOP_PASTE`
* `TOP_POINTER_CANCEL`
* `TOP_POINTER_DOWN`
* `TOP_POINTER_ENTER`
* `TOP_POINTER_LEAVE`
* `TOP_POINTER_MOVE`
* `TOP_POINTER_OUT`
* `TOP_POINTER_OVER`
* `TOP_POINTER_UP`
* `TOP_SCROLL`
* `TOP_SELECTION_CHANGE`
* `TOP_TEXT_INPUT`
* `TOP_TOGGLE`
* `TOP_TOUCH_CANCEL`
* `TOP_TOUCH_END`
* `TOP_TOUCH_MOVE`
* `TOP_TOUCH_START`
* `TOP_TRANSITION_END`
* `TOP_WHEEL`

From these lists, it follows that:

* “Media events should not be listened to on top level” is generally true.
* `TOP_LOAD_START` is an exception to the previous rule: even though it’s a media event, we listen to it on the top level.
* There are three additional events (`TOP_INVALID`, `TOP_RESET`, and `TOP_SUBMIT`) that are *neither* in the media nor the top whitelist. So we should exclude them *too*.

That’s reflected in my switch structure:

```js
      switch (dependency) {
        // ... other special cases ...
        case TOP_INVALID:
        case TOP_SUBMIT:
        case TOP_RESET:
          // We listen to them on the target DOM elements.
          // Some of them bubble so we don't want them to fire twice.
          break;
        case TOP_LOAD_START:
          // Even though it's a media event, it also exists on <img>.
          // So we need to listen at top level, unlike other media events.
          trapBubbledEvent(dependency, mountAt);
          break;
        default:
          // By default, listen on the top level to all non-media events.
          const isMediaEvent = mediaEventTypes.indexOf(dependency) !== -1;
          if (!isMediaEvent) {
            trapBubbledEvent(dependency, mountAt);
          }
          break;
      }
```

Note that I’m introducing an `indexOf` lookup there. I think it’s fine because this code only runs once per event, and `indexOf` is very fast on small arrays (`mediaEventTypes` has 23 elements). So I wouldn’t expect this to regress anything. But I can turn it into an object lookup if needed.",2,4,2018-05-22T14:34:09Z,2018-05-22T18:50:37Z,2018-05-22T18:50:37Z,4346,0 days 04:16:28

This change is being made so that DevTools has the ability to display timing info for all components in an application (or a subtree) simply by flipping the root `Fiber` and its alternate to `ProfileMode`.

This change should have no impact on the production bundle since the newly added fields are stripped out if `enableProfilerTimer` is disabled. It should have minimal impact on the dev and [production profiling](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12886) bundles since measurements are only recorded if `ProfileMode` is active.

### Checklist
- [x] All existing unit tests pass.
- [x] Bundle size isn't impacted for non-profiling builds. (See below.)
- [x] Reset ""actual"" time durations for all Fibers after commit- even ones that didn't update due to bailouts. (Otherwise their durations will accumulate for the next eventual re-render.)
- [x] Don't reset durations before DevTools commit hook is called. (Otherwise DevTools will be unable to read these values for profiling mode.)

ReactTestRenderer and ReactDOM portals,12895,39,0,2,"Resolves issue #11565

Adds a warning when a React DOM portal is passed to ReactTestRenderer.

`ReactTestRenderer` should not runtime error when rendering content that includes a portal created by `ReactDOM.createPortal()`. This PR introduces a new feature flag- used only by the test renderer- that converts portals to fragments, enabling them to be rendered and represented as JSON by the test renderer.

## Before
This test fails:
```js
ReactTestRenderer.create(ReactDOM.createPortal('foo', container));
```
With a confusing error:
> TypeError: parentInstance.children.indexOf is not a function

I think we should either provide a more helpful warning (see 7d57c8a) or support it enough to at least render a JSON representation of the tree (see current implementation).

## After
### Test
```js
const container = document.createElement('div');
let rendered = ReactTestRenderer.create(
  <div>
    {ReactDOM.createPortal(<span>ReactDOM portal</span>, container)}
  </div>,
);
expect(rendered.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();

rendered.update(
  <div>

"[scheduler] 4/n Allow splitting out `schedule` in fb-www, prepare to fix polyfill issue internally",12900,64,5,8,"**Edit:** This PR has been rebased and no longer has an cruft from previous PRs.

**what is the change?:**
- Uses references to global APIs instead of directly calling global APIs themselves inside of exported functions.
- Shim the 'schedule' module itself in `www`, planning to use the generated bundle instead of inlining it.
- Create a `react-scheduler` bundle for `fb-www`

**why make this change?:**
Context: internally we polyfill `requestAnimationFrame` and `setTimeout` and other global APIs. These ""polyfills"" also add and modify the functionality of the APIs, in ways that are not compatible with React.

We need more control over the version of those APIs that is used by the `schedule` module. To manage this, we want to try loading the `schedule` module before the polyfills are loaded, and holding a reference to the original `requestAnimationFrame` API.

To require `schedule` early we need to split it out from React. This diff takes a simple approach to that - we still want `schedule` bundled with React for open source, but internally we want it to be a separate module.

I'll run the sync next week and verify that this all works. :)

Always use event capturing. Remove media events.,12919,236,283,9,"**What**

I finally had a chance to circle back on what I learned investigating event listener attachment. 

In short, we distinguished between captured and bubbled events, however I believe this is not necessary as of IE9+. Captured events do not appear to exhibit the same edge cases as bubbled events, allowing us to simplify event code.

**Why do we want to do this?**

I think we can probably drastically reduce the code for eagerly attaching listeners for events that do not bubble. So far, all events that do not bubble appear to capture on parent elements. 

Longer term, [I wonder if we can remove the `.bind()` when attaching listeners](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/events/ReactDOMEventListener.js#L180), and maybe even remove top level types.

**More info**

This commit changes event subscription such that all events are attached with capturing. This prevents the need to eagerly attach media event listeners to video, audio, and source tags, and simplifies the event subscription process.

I think we can probably extend this to more event types, maybe [most/all eager event attachments](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMFiberComponent.js#L451-L516), but that will require substantial testing. Until that time, this commit lays the foundation for that work by demonstrating that capturing is applicable in cases where bubbling does not occur.

**Test plan**

1. Verify fixtures on https://react-capture-all-events.surge.sh/media-events
2. Verify fixtures on https://react-capture-all-events.surge.sh/input-change-events
3. Verify fixtures on https://react-capture-all-events.surge.sh/pointer-events

I believe these to be the key event types to test, however this change definitely affects all event listeners.

[scheduler] 5/n Error handling in scheduler,12920,624,30,3,"**what is the change?:**
We set a flag before calling any callback, and then use a 'try/finally'
block to wrap it. Note that we *do not* catch the error, if one is
thrown. But, we only unset the flag after the callback successfully
finishes.

If we reach the 'finally' block and the flag was not unset, then it
means an error was thrown.

In that case we start a new postMessage callback, to finish calling any
other pending callbacks if there is time.

**why make this change?:**
We need to make sure that an error thrown from one callback doesn't stop
other callbacks from firing, but we also don't want to catch or swallow
the error because we want engineers to still be able to log and debug
errors. And we don't want to push errors into the wrong frame or change their timing - this simulates almost exactly how it would work with 'requestAnimationFrame' if the callback throws an error.

**test plan:**
New tests added are passing, and we verified that they fail without this
change.

In particular, the fixture shows how errors and callbacks act in a real browser and compares the 'schedule.scheduleWork' method to 'requestAnimationFrame'. In Chrome the results are the same:

Rename variables to remove references to 'global' global,12931,10,10,2,"**what is the change?:**
In a recent PR we were referencing some global variables and storing
local references to them.

To make things more natural, we co-opted the original name of the global
for our local reference. To make this work with Flow, we get the
original reference from 'window.requestAnimationFrame' and assign it to
'const requestAnimationFrame'.

Sometimes React is used in an environment where 'window' is not defined
- in that case we need to use something else, or hide the 'window'
reference somewhere.

We opted to use 'global' thinking that Babel transforms would fill that
in with the proper thing.

But for some of our fixtures we are not doing that transform on the
bundle.

**why make this change?:**
I want to unbreak this on master and then investigate more about what we
should do to fix this.

Would like to land this quick fix but ultimately would like to avoid using the confusing 'localRequestAnimationFrame' naming.

Failing test for Context bug in ReactPartialRenderer,12974,30,0,1,"A failing test for the bug reported in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12968

This is possible because context is stored on the Context element itself, so it's mutated as the components are rendered. In this case, the wrong value is being set on a provider when its being popped:

https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/36546b5137e9012ebdc62fc9ec11e3518c9e0aab/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactPartialRenderer.js#L692-L700

`previousProvider` ends up being the provider for the other context, so the next time it renders it has the wrong value. The assumption that the context type is correct because of the index check isn't accurate. It's also strange that it's always setting the context value to `previousProvider.props.value`, even if the provider doesn't have a value.

Not sure what the right fix is, but I'd like to figure it out 😄

Fallback to event.srcElement for IE9,12976,3,1,1,"It looks like we accidentally removed a fallback condition for the event target in IE9 when we dropped some support for IE8. This commit adds the event target specific support code back to getEventTarget.js

**Test Plan**

1. Open IE9
2. Visit http://react-nh-fix-ie9-target.surge.sh/number-inputs
3. Try to enter text into the inputs

**Local Behavior:** Includes this fix. `event.target` falls back to `event.srcElement` and text correctly updates
**16.4.0 Behavior:** Text does not update because event.target.value references the window, which is always undefined.

Remove rAF fork,12980,18,70,6,"**what is the change?:**
Undid https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12837

**why make this change?:**
We originally forked rAF because we needed to pull in a particular
version of rAF internally at Facebook, to avoid grabbing the default
polyfilled version.

The longer term solution, until we can get rid of the global polyfill
behavior, is to initialize 'schedule' before the polyfilling happens.

Now that we have landed and synced
https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12900 successfully, we can
initialize 'schedule' before the polyfill runs.
So we can remove the rAF fork. Here is how it will work:

1. Land this PR on Github.
2. Flarnie will quickly run a sync getting this change into www.
3. We delete the internal forked version of
   'requestAnimationFrameForReact'.
4. We require 'schedule' in the polyfill file itself, before the
   polyfilling happens.

**test plan:**
Flarnie will manually try the above steps locally and verify that things
work.

Allow multiple root children in test renderer traversal API,13017,101,34,2,"This should fix some bugs @sahrens was seeing.

Test renderer traversal API currently treats ""fragmenty"" nodes (fragments, providers, modes) as passthrough. That usually works, but it breaks down at the top level. The `.root` node has to point to a Fiber, so if it's a ""passthrough"" Fiber, we currently invariant.

Ideally I think the root node should have always been a special kind of ""root"" whose `type` and `props` don't match the nearest ""materialized"" node. But that ship has sailed, and changing this would be breaking.

So for now I want to enable those use cases by only ""materializing"" a special root node (with `type: null, props: null`) when it has multiple children.

It should be mostly additive because that kind of code used to throw. It *does* change the behavior for a top-level non-keyed fragment with many children (we used to ignore all children but the first) but this actually sounds like a bugfix to me, especially given that subsequent children were *not* ignored in the `toJSON()` API.

In the future, we probably should change `.root` to always be a special node, regardless of whether it has one or more children.",9,6,2018-06-11T15:14:44Z,2018-06-11T19:03:51Z,2018-06-11T19:03:51Z,1151,0 days 03:49:07

This diff changes the server stack to behave more similarly to what we do on the client. I'm using two stacks in practice: one stack for the ""context"" objects and one for the ""values"" we need to restore them to on the way up.

I also have a DEV-only stack for providers. I could've used it for context objects too, but I decided it's nice to avoid some property access on every pop when we need to read the context object. So I only use the provider stack for push/pop mismatch validation, just like we do in Fiber.

Use native event dispatching instead of Simulate or SimulateNative,13023,959,832,23,"In #12629 @gaearon suggested that it would be better to drop usage of `ReactTestUtils.Simulate` and `ReactTestUtils.SimulateNative`. In this PR I’m attempting at removing it from a lot of places with only a few leftovers. 

Those leftovers can be categorized into three groups:

1. Anything that tests that `SimulateNative` throws. This is a property that native event dispatching doesn’t have so I can’t convert that easily. Affected test suites: `EventPluginHub-test`, `ReactBrowserEventEmitter-test`.
2. Anything that tests `ReactTestUtils` directly. Affected test suites: `ReactBrowserEventEmitter-test` (this file has one test that reads ""should have mouse enter simulated by test utils""), `ReactTestUtils-test`.
3. Anything that dispatches a `change` event. The reason here goes a bit deeper and is rooted in the way we shim onChange. Usually when using native event dispatching, you would set the node’s `.value` and then dispatch the event. However inside [`inputValueTracking.js`][] we install a setter on the node’s `.value` that will ignore the next `change` event (I found [this][near-perfect-oninput-shim] article from Sophie that explains that this is to avoid onChange when updating the value via JavaScript).

All remaining usages of `Simulate` or `SimulateNative` can be avoided by mounting the containers inside the `document` and dispatching native events.

Here some remarks:

1. I’m using `Element#click()` instead of `dispatchEvent`. In the jsdom changelog I read that `click()` now properly sets the correct values (you can also verify it does the same thing by looking at the [source][jsdom-source]).
2. I had to update jsdom in order to get `TouchEvent` constructors working (and while doing so also updated jest). There was one unexpected surprise: `ReactScheduler-test` was relying on not having `window.performance` available. I’ve recreated the previous environment by deleting this property from the global object.
3. I was a bit confused that `ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument()` does not render into the document 🤷‍

A lot of this doesn't really make much sense in a persistent world but
currently we can't dispatch events to memoizedProps on a Fiber since
they're pooled. Also, it's unclear what the semantics should be when we
dispatch an event that happened when the old props were in effect but now
we have new props already.

This implementation tries to use the last committed props but also fails
at that because we don't have a commit hook in the persistent mode.

However, at least it doesn't crash when dispatching. :)

Automatically Profile roots when DevTools is present,13058,135,1,4,"I'm working on a new DevTools plug-in that uses the new profiler timings to create charts about an application's rendering performance. One of these charts will be a flame graph that shows all fibers in an application. The width of each fiber will be based on its `treeBaseTime` (the time it last took to render) and the color will be based on how much time it took relative to the longest running parts of the commit. Here's a small demo:
![react-devtools-profiling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/41494154-51f69a94-70c4-11e8-97ff-a61c695aa3bb.gif)

### Profiling when DevTools are present

My original idea was for DevTools to walk each root and turn `ProfileMode` on for all fibers when the user started profiling. (PR #12910 was created in order to support this functionality.) I made an oversight though. React does not collect timing information for fibers that aren't in `ProfileMode`, and so `selfBaseTime` and `treeBaseTime` values are all set to 0. This means that when a user starts profiling, base times are all 0. These times get updated when a fiber next renders– but not if it bails out. This means that in some cases, parts of the tree will not have base times and the resulting graph will be inaccurate.

There are a couple of options to address this:
1. Profiling builds of React always collection timing information if DevTools has been detected. This way the base time information is already present when a user starts profiling. (This has an added benefit of not requiring DevTools to crawl each tree and modify the `mode` when recording starts.)
2. DevTools somehow forces a deep re-render (that ignores `shouldComponentUpdate`) when profiling is started so that all fiber are guaranteed to have a base time value.

This PR adopts the first option, but I'm happy to discuss the second one if there are strong preferences or concerns.

### Testing DevTools profiler integration

This PR also updates the test renderer to inject itself into DevTools if the global hook is present. This was done so that I could add a test for the otherwise unobservable profiling behavior. (It may also be useful for other tests.)

I made a few judgement calls here that I don't feel strongly about and would be happy to discuss changing:
1. Test renderer does not support the `findFiberByHostInstance` method because I didn't want to add the overhead of mapping instances to fibers until/unless we had a need for that feature.
1. Test renderer DevTools injection is based on a new `supportDevToolsIfPresent` feature flag, which is only enabled for the tests that depend on it.
1. I updated the other DevTools-capable renderers to also check this feature flag because it seemed a bit weird not to. (I particularly don't feel strongly about this change.)",7,5,2018-06-16T01:07:50Z,2018-06-20T16:24:53Z,2018-06-20T16:24:53Z,2793,4 days 15:17:03

Convert react to named exports,13080,63,61,16,"In this diff I'm making a step forward to esm support.

Here I export scoped variables instead of object. Conditions are
resolved with with ternary operator.

To solve the problem of using both `import * as React from 'react'`
and `import React from 'react'` I removed `__esModule` field with simple
regexp. In the future rollup release this will be achived with
[new rollup option](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/2287).

New bundles are tested with webpack, rollup and babel-jest. All ways
produce same results.

There was a problem with reexports in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11526
and as you can see in examples below it's solved so we can migrate
react-dom to named exports aswell in the next PR.

Fix crash during server render in react 16.4.1.,13088,9,2,1,"This fixes a crash that only occurs in react-dom 16.4.1.

Fall back to 'setTimeout' when 'requestAnimationFrame' is not called,13091,50,3,2,"Will you be the hero to review this PR?
Would be great to get the fix landed in Monday's sync. 😁

**what is the change?:**
If 'requestAnimationFrame' is not called for 100ms we fall back to
'setTimeout' to schedule the postmessage.

**why make this change?:**
When you start loading a page, and then switch tabs,
'requestAnimationFrame' is throttled or not called until you come back
to that tab. That means React's rendering, any any other scheduled work,
are paused.

Users expect the page to continue loading, and rendering is part of the
page load in a React app. So we need to continue calling callbacks.

**test plan:**
Manually tested using the new fixture test, observed that the callbacks
were called while switched to another tab. They were called more
slowly, but that seems like a reasonable thing.

Only de-indented templates would have transformed CRLFs to LFs. So there are chances that string interpolations contains one or more CRLFs, thus failing the RegExp test.

"fix(transition): check existence of `el.parentNode`, fix #8199",8422,30,1,3,"Fix #8199 
If the new parentNode gets a `textContent` or `innerHTML` property during patching, the `transition` node would have been detached early, which means `el.parentNode` no longer exists.
So this existential check is necessary.

This is an imperfect fix because while errors are suppressed, transition animations still get lost.
It is due to the different mechanism of `v-html` and VDOM element patching. But fixing that would be much more complex and I don't think we'd bother fixing such an edge case.

**Other information:**

Currently, the return type of `default` option is annotated with `object` since it is used for generating fresh object for each component instance. But there is another use case for `default` option of function in [portal-vue](https://github.com/LinusBorg/portal-vue) which is for dynamically generating unique value as default.
https://github.com/LinusBorg/portal-vue/blob/develop/src/components/portal.js#L16

The current typing breaks `this` type inference when the `default` function returns non-object type. I just relaxed the return type to `any` to avoid breaking the inference.",2,4,2018-07-21T04:01:45Z,2018-09-18T02:33:58Z,2018-09-18T02:33:58Z,1445,58 days 22:32:13

Currently, when transforming `data.model` in `createElement` function, it does not check if the component is a functional component, causing a double update on `v-model`. This prevents double update on v-model in functional components by not transforming model when `Ctor.options.functional` is `true`.

Currently for older browsers (IE9~IE11) we cannot use `v-html` on SVG elements because they don't support `innerHTML` for SVG elements. While actually we can fix this without much effort and make it “just works”. As `innerHTML` is defined for `Element` interface (which `SVGElement` is derived from) [in the latest spec](https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#dfn-innerhtml), I think it's reasonable to add this for `v-html`.

**Other information:**

Related issues: #5310 #5756

Since it's a browser-specific fix and we don't run tests for IE locally, I created a repo to demonstrate the fix: https://github.com/Justineo/v-html-svg

* With latest `vue` on `unpkg.com`, see: https://justineo.github.io/v-html-svg/test-original.html
* After the fix, see: https://justineo.github.io/v-html-svg/test-fixed.html

I've tested and it should now work in IE 9~IE 11.

in the accessibility error for not complying with WCAG2 A. In the western countries, the public
sites built with Vuejs in such way have the risks of being sued for not making the sites accessible.

fix(sfc): do not deindent space-padded output,8724,6,3,2,"**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:

`parseComponent('...', { pad: 'space' }).script.content` will contain code with base indent if SFC content has base indent. Also applies to styles or etc.

As #5058 and #5059, `pad: 'space'` is for character-oriented tools that calculate positions by distance from the beginning of the file instead of by line. This should be applied to source code itself, so I think it was buggy and breaking change is unavoidable.

Add aiochan,1121,1,0,1,"## What is this Python project?

[aiochan](https://github.com/zh217/aiochan) is a concurrency library that is used on top of the built-in library [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). It provides channels together with `put`, `get` and `select` operations on them as its concurrency primitives, thus enabling CSP-style concurrency programs to be written (like in Go or in Clojure's core.async). In additions to lots of convenient methods and functions which enable easy-to-read and easy-to-write concurrent dataflow, there are also methods provided that can overcome python's GIL restriction in order to fully utilise all CPU cores on a single machine.

## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

None of the libraries already listed is similar to this one. Compared to those that are not listed (such as [python-csp](https://github.com/futurecore/python-csp), [aiochannel](https://github.com/tbug/aiochannel) and [aiostream](https://github.com/vxgmichel/aiostream)), they do not enable the full CSP-style programming (usually they do not provide `select`, which must be implemented inside the channel), or they are not actively maintained at all and do not work well with the newest python versions.

Add RESTful API / flask-rest-api,1122,1,0,1,"Repo: https://github.com/Nobatek/flask-rest-api/
Docs: https://flask-rest-api.readthedocs.io

## What is this Python project?

DB agnostic framework to build auto-documented REST APIs with Flask and marshmallow

## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

This is a glue layer on top of great libraries from the marshmallow ecosystem:

- marshmallow itself for serialization, deserialization and validation
- webargs to parse request arguments
- apispec to generate OpenAPI documentation

flask-rest-api does not develop its own serialization/deserialization logic, which means less potential errors. It relies on marshmallow, which is a reference library for those tasks. It reduces the boilerplate even more if the application uses an ORM or ODM that can generate marshmallow schemas from the database model (marshmallow-sqlalchemy, umongo or marshmallow-mongoengine,...).

The OpenAPI (Swagger) specification is automatically generated, yet customizable, and exposed with ReDoc or Swagger UI.

It includes features not found in other similar frameworks:

- Pagination
- ETag

flask-rest-api is Python3 only. It supports marshmallow 2 and 3.

Add pytest-cov plugin,1138,1,0,1,"## What is this Python project?

This is a Python plugin to measure and generate reports of code coverage.
It is very simple to use, is MIT licensed and is compatible with coverage package.

## What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

Compared to coverage the `pytest-cov` plugin does some extras:

- Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get covered without any fuss.
- Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist's features and still get coverage.
- Consistent pytest behavior. If you run coverage run -m pytest you will have slightly different sys.path (CWD will be in it, unlike when running pytest).

Bug fix: tf.assert_* prints the entire input by default in eager mode,22787,29,0,2,"With the exception of `assert_equal`, all the ops that invoke `tf.Assert` will print out their input tensors in their entirety by default when running in eager mode.

```
tf.assert_greater(np.zeros([1000,1000], dtype=np.float32), 0.)
```
will generate a five megabyte error message when running in eager mode.

This pull request changes the behavior of the `summarize` argument of `tf.Assert` (and by extension all the other ops that call `tf.Assert) to be the same in eager mode as in graph mode. Specifically, after the changes in this PR, the default number of elements to print will be 3, and values of `summarize` less than zero will cause all elements to be printed. I also added a test case.",1,6,2018-10-06T00:16:24Z,2018-10-15T20:13:40Z,2018-10-15T20:13:40Z,823,9 days 19:57:16
TFTRT User provided INT8 quantization scales,22788,2,7,2,"TF-TRT now supports the following quantization nodes:
- QuantizeAndDequantizeV2
- QuantizeAndDequantizeV3
- FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars
- FakeQuantWithMinMaxArgs

When these nodes are converted:
1. Their quantization ranges are extracted and stored
2. The nodes are removed
3. The ranges are applied to the relevant tensors

This enables a path for TF-TRT to deploy models trained with quantization in the loop, for example those trained with tf.contrib.quantize.

trt.create_inference_graph() has a new boolean argument, `use_calibration`.
If we are in INT8 mode and use_calibration=True, create_inference_graph will return a calibration graph just like it did previously.
The calibrator will not override ranges provided via quantization nodes.
If we are in INT8 mode and use_calibration=False, a warning will be issued for every tensor which does not have a calibration range. Since TRT may fuse some operations, users may not always need to provide a value for these tensors. If a tensor that TRT needs is missing, the conversion will fail.

This PR also adds support for Relu6 nodes, and fixes a bug with not renaming tensors.

Current Issues/Considerations:
- If a model was trained with quantization nodes in places where TRT will not quantize (i.e. due to op fusion), then accuracy may drop dramatically. The solution is to figure out which ops will be fused by TRT and avoid placing quantization nodes between those ops. Another option is to place clip ops with each quantization node, so that if the tensor is not quantized it will still be clipped to be in the expected range - this will impact performace negatively.
- TRT does not have documentation for op fusion yet.
- TRT only supports symmetric quantization. Ranges are converted to symmetric ranges using `max(abs(min_range), abs(max_range))`.
- Since the tensors which are inputs and outputs to the TRTEngine are renamed to ""TensorRTInputPH_{X}"", ""TensorRTOutputPH_{X}"", if these tensors are missing ranges the warnings will not make sense to users.
- MatMul and BiasAdd are not fused, requiring users to provide a range between these ops.",17,9,2018-10-06T02:16:41Z,2018-11-22T09:16:25Z,2018-11-22T09:16:25Z,2129,47 days 06:59:44

adds the appropriate symlinks to the full name from the base and
soversion.

The soname is used by compilers to fill in the DT_NEEDED section in the
header of binaries that link to the library. Having the version means
that different versions of the library are able to co-exist and if the
ABI changes, programs linking to the lib do not break.

Bazel-0.18.0 is changing where it searches for .bazelrc files.
Originally it was removing /tools/bazel.rc and only using /.bazelrc.
This causes issues for gitignoring /.bazelrc and 0.18.0 has temporarily
added tools/bazel.rc back to the list until 0.19. The long term solution
is to use try-import but that statement is new in 0.18 and we are not
going to bump TF's minimum right away. When 0.19 is out things will need
to be changed back and the minimum bumped to 0.18.

https://github.com/JuliaDiff/DiffRules.jl/blob/master/src/rules.jl#L94

To support these sorts of patterns, add a simple if conversion pass that converts
conditionals in parallel context by equivalent select operations (which are well supported),
i.e. a computation like:

```
if {
 %pif = () parameter(0)
 ROOT %cif = f32[] constant(0)
}

else {
 %pelse = () parameter(0)
 ROOT %celse = f32[] constant(1)
}

mapped {
 %a = f32[] parameter(0)
 %b = f32[] parameter(1)
 %lt = pred[] less-than(%a, %b)
 %t = () tuple()
 ROOT %conditional = f32[] conditional(%lt, %t, %t), true_computation=if, false_computation=else
}

ENTRY comp {
 %p1 = f32[1000]{0} parameter(0)
 %p2 = f32[1000]{0} parameter(1)
 ROOT %mapped = f32[1000]{0} map(%p1, %p2), dimensions={0}, to_apply=mapped
}
```

gets rewritten to

```
mapped {
 %a = f32[] parameter(0)
 %b = f32[] parameter(1)
 %cif = f32[] constant(0)
 %celse = f32[] constant(1)
 %lt = pred[] less-than(%a, %b)
 ROOT %select = f32[] select(%lt, %cif, %celse)
}

ENTRY comp {
 %p1 = f32[1000]{0} parameter(0)
 %p2 = f32[1000]{0} parameter(1)
 ROOT %mapped = f32[1000]{0} map(%p1, %p2) dimensions={0} to_apply=mapped
}
```

To keep things simple, this is accomplished by first rewriting the conditional
to two calls and a select and then inlining the individual calls. Naturally,
the transformation is only applied if the called computation do not
have side effects (which they generally don't if they're in parallel
context). In the future, it would be good to let MapInliner further
simplify this to an implicitly mapped select.",18,10,2018-10-14T23:52:58Z,2019-03-18T21:36:50Z,2019-03-18T21:36:50Z,2001,154 days 21:43:52

GDR contrib- Suballocators fixes,22989,14,12,2,"This patch includes two fixes, all in the gdr contribution
The 1st one changes the ordering of the calls to gdr memory manager initialization and grpc initialization.

This is necessary because gdr initialization may initiates the GPU device and call GetCPUAllocator (or GetGPUAllocator), which are asserted to never occur before the registration of Suballocators to ProcessState's singleton (which happens on gdr memory manager init)

The 2nd fix is to change the cuda host sub allocators to be registered on both Numas, 0 and 1.
This fixed an error on my servers, and I think it should be fine on different setups too but please comment if you think I missed something.

Add Apache Arrow Support to TensorFlow Dataset,23002,1371,0,15,"Apache Arrow is a standard format for in-memory columnar data. It provides a cross-language platform for systems to communicate and operate on data efficiently.

Adding Arrow support in TensorFlow Dataset will allow systems to interface with TensorFlow in a well defined way, without the need to develop custom converters, serialize data, or write to specialized files.

This PR defines an Arrow base layer that will create a TensorFlow Dataset with an iterator over Arrow record batches to produce Tensor values for each column. This base layer is then extended to implement three Dataset Ops that consume Arrow record batches: 1) from Python memory / Pandas DataFrames, 2) Reading Arrow Feather files, 3) Input stream with a socket client to connect to a server streaming Arrow record batches. These are implemented now because they are straightforward and can provide some good initial functionality, but the design here should allow for more Arrow Ops in the future.

Fix multiprocess support in data_utils.py Enqueuer classes,23011,493,263,2,"This was originally to fix #22804, but after some googling it seems multi-process support has been an issue for awhile.  See also:

* https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/13
* https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/4142
* https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/1638
* https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/3962

This PR should address all of these (on Linux) and fixes the Enqueuer classes to use the correct multiprocessing constructs. I've done my best to follow the threading/multiprocessing best-practices in the Python docs.

#### Approach

Rather than go down the rabbit hole of complex if/else logic to handle the different threading/multiprocessing use cases I've instead broken the logic out into separate, dedicated classes.  The top level GeneratorEnqueuer and OrderedEnqueuer classes simply dispatch to the appropriate implementation depending on whether the user specifies `use_multiprocessing` or not.

In addition to fixing the problems with multi-processing support (hanging, not sharing/synchronizing state correctly), I've also cleaned up and refactored the code to try and eliminate duplicated logic and misc other bugs.  For example I encountered some thread starvation issues due to mistakes with how locks were being used (the tests 'passed' and returned data in the 'right order,' but a peek under the hood showed all or most of the work was actually being done by a single thread).

Some final points:

* I replaced the class global variables that were being used to share state with standard mechanisms from the `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules (and class globals don't work across processes anyways)

* As a side effect of using the right synchronization mechanisms it should no longer matter if generators passed to GeneratorEnqueuer are thread-safe or not, the new implementation should handle things correctly regardless.

* The tests have mostly been left as-is to show that the API is maintained and none of the regressions break.  One thing I did notice is that the test for the multi-processed GeneratorEnqueuer used the wrong assertion.  I think this is because multi-processing wasn't working and it was done to get the test suite to pass?  Regardless I've updated it to use the same assertion as in the threaded version of the test:

```diff
   def test_generator_enqueuer_threads(self):
     enqueuer = keras.utils.data_utils.GeneratorEnqueuer(
         create_generator_from_sequence_threads(TestSequence([3, 200, 200, 3])),
         use_multiprocessing=False)
     enqueuer.start(3, 10)
     gen_output = enqueuer.get()
     acc = []
     for _ in range(100):
       acc.append(int(next(gen_output)[0, 0, 0, 0]))

     self.assertEqual(len(set(acc) - set(range(100))), 0)
     enqueuer.stop()

   @unittest.skipIf(
       os.name == 'nt',
       'use_multiprocessing=True does not work on windows properly.')
   def test_generator_enqueuer_processes(self):
     enqueuer = keras.utils.data_utils.GeneratorEnqueuer(
         create_generator_from_sequence_pcs(TestSequence([3, 200, 200, 3])),
         use_multiprocessing=True)
     enqueuer.start(3, 10)
     gen_output = enqueuer.get()
     acc = []
     for _ in range(100):
       acc.append(int(next(gen_output)[0, 0, 0, 0]))
-    self.assertNotEqual(acc, list(range(100)))
+    self.assertEqual(len(set(acc) - set(range(100))), 0)
     enqueuer.stop()
```

[aborted] Clean up binary element-wise assertions,23090,0,0,0,"**Edit: Accidentally messed up my branch. Recreating my changes in a new branch and resubmitting this PR.**

TensorFlow 1.5 added two pieces of useful functionality to the `assert_equals` op. In eager mode, `assert_equals` now prints a more useful error message that pinpoints which elements of the input tensors differ (see [commit 361c55899cb524ca078c65eabdd3d79bfc10c8f9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/361c55899cb524ca078c65eabdd3d79bfc10c8f9)). In graph mode, `assert_equals` now evaluates the assertion at graph construction time when both inputs can be evaluated statically (see [commit cfbeafe11d9b86f8685c1c0f97d285885b5a5f1f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cfbeafe11d9b86f8685c1c0f97d285885b5a5f1f)).

This PR ports this additional functionality to the other binary element-wise assertion ops `assert_none_equal`, `assert_less`, `assert_less_equal`, `assert_greater`, and `assert_greater_equal`.

In the process, I replaced a bunch of near-duplicate code and documentation across the `assert_*` functions with a single function (`_binary_assert()` in `check_ops.py`) and common blocks of documentation (`_binary_assert_doc()` and `_unary_assert_doc()` in `check_ops.py`). `check_ops.py` is now about 125 lines shorter.

I added some new regression tests to cover static assertion checks in graph mode and modified some existing tests to account for the new functionality.

I built a local copy of the documentation for the `tf.debugging` package and reviewed all the resulting Markdown files.

[Redo of #23090] Clean up binary element-wise assertions,23109,525,506,16,"**The working branch off of which PR #23090 was based was destroyed in a tragic git accident. This PR is a redo of the same changes.**

**The reviewers on the original PR were @ymodak and @iganichev. @rohan100jain was also following the original PR.**

**Original description follows:**


TensorFlow 1.5 added two pieces of useful functionality to the `assert_equals` op. In eager mode, `assert_equals` now prints a more useful error message that pinpoints which elements of the input tensors differ (see [commit 361c55899cb524ca078c65eabdd3d79bfc10c8f9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/361c55899cb524ca078c65eabdd3d79bfc10c8f9)). In graph mode, `assert_equals` now evaluates the assertion at graph construction time when both inputs can be evaluated statically (see [commit cfbeafe11d9b86f8685c1c0f97d285885b5a5f1f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cfbeafe11d9b86f8685c1c0f97d285885b5a5f1f)).

This PR ports this additional functionality to the other binary element-wise assertion ops `assert_none_equal`, `assert_less`, `assert_less_equal`, `assert_greater`, and `assert_greater_equal`.

Switch from Deprecated to Current Docker Images on Docker Hub,23206,28,3,3,"This PR is intended as follow-up to the proposal in Issue #23170 to host Tensorflow's currently developed Dockerfile images on Docker Hub.

From the Issue:

>Tensorflow's Dockerfiles are [currently located](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/dockerfiles/dockerfiles) at `tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/dockerfiles/dockerfiles/`. The parent directory (`tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/dockerfiles/`) includes instructions to build the images from that directory. This is done so the Dockerfiles have the `bashrc` file in their build context to `COPY` into containers at runtime. 
>
>There are another set of Dockerfiles at `tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/docker/` which are marked deprecated/for-deletion. These deprecated Dockerfiles are the ones currently hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/).
>
>I propose Tensorflow switch their publicly available Docker images from the deprecated set to current ones. With minimal upfront effort, all eight current images could be hosted on Docker Hub and automatically rebuilt with each repo update.

I pushed the images from this PR to the `imburbank/tensorflow` [repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/imburbank/tensorflow/ 'Docker Hub') on Docker Hub for now. All the images can be run with `imburbank/tensorflow:[Docker Tag Name]`. The hosted images:tags are as follows:

Fix documentation for deprecated args,23226,113,8,2,"While reading the API docs, I noticed that some of the deprecation notices seem to have missing pieces. For example, this notice in `tf.math.argmax`:

I traced the problem to a bug in the `@deprecated_args` decorator. The message that the decorator generates for docstrings is different from the message it generates for runtime warnings. Instructions that make sense in the context of the runtime warning message don't make sense in the context of the API docs.

This PR makes the deprecation message for docstrings more like the one for warnings. After the changes in this PR, the deprecation notice for `tf.math.argmax` looks like this:

[Features]mixed precision support enhancement using decorator,23244,1678,1,4,"This feature realize the automatic/constant loss scaling algorithm in Backprop, which can help preserve small gradient magnitudes ( ref to  https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html)
Mixed precision with loss scaling is already support by tf.contrib.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer,  with the following usage:
```python
loss = loss_fn()
opt = tf.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=...)

# Choose a loss scale manager which decides how to pick the right loss scale
# throughout the training process.
loss_scale_manger = tf.contrib.mixed_precision.FixedLossScaleManager(5000)

# Wraps the original optimizer in a LossScaleOptimizer.
loss_scale_optimizer = LossScaleOptimizer(opt, loss_scale_manager)

# Call minimize() on the loss scale optimizer.
train_op = loss_scale_optimizer.minimize(loss)

The optimizer `LossScaleOptimizer` is actually a wrapper of other optimizers.  However, the usage using wrapper is too limited to support all cases.  For example,
    + if the users  are using `tf.gradients()` to compute the gradients rather than `optimizer.compute_gradients()`/`optimizer.minimize()`,  the wrapper is no longer in user. 
    + the `LossScaleOptimizer` wrapper may have compatibility problem with other optimizer wrappers, e.g. `SyncReplicasOptimizer`
    + the current implementation in `LossScaleOptimizer` did not take the colocation parameter into consideration. 

Instead, we implement loss scaling using a decorator on `gradients()`, which is the atom function to compute the backprop gradients. The usage is as following:
```python
loss = loss_fn()
opt = tf.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=...)
# constant loss scaling with loss_scale=64
with tf.mixed_precision_scope(automatic_loss_scaling=False, loss_scale=64):
      grad = tf.gradients()  # if using tf.gradients

with tf.mixed_precision_scope(automatic_loss_scaling=True):
      grad = tf.gradients()  # if using tf.gradients

[Features] Enable Variable Partitioning in ParameterServerStrategy graph mode,23254,129,14,4,"Hi @yuefengz ,

Variable Partitioning is very important in Parameter Server architecture for loading balancing. It has been widely used in Recommendation systems for distributing the large embedding variables. 

In `DistributionStrategy` architecture, the variable partitioner is ignored to all cases. I understand it will be complicated if we enable variables partitioner to all cases such as  `Eager`. It may be even involved with the `PartitionVariableScope` in TF 2.0 which will influence `tf.Variable` declaration with `tf.variable_creator_scope`.  However, it is easy and suitable to support partitioning on `ParameterServerStrategy` in graph mode. Every subclasses of  `DistributionStrategy` can override `_allow_variable_partition` method to decide whether to enable it or not. Currently, only `ParameterServerStrategy` has override it.

It would be appreciated to have a discussion  if there is another solutions to support variable partitioner.

Prevent memory leak by storing strings instead of StringPiece in vector,23279,6,6,2,"This fixes a memory leak where a `StringPiece` stored in a vector, hence the `AttrVec` here, outlives the `const char*` buffer he has been initialized with.

I observed this behaviour by adding an attribute value to the `AttrBuilder` from JNI code (Java Native), where the buffer has to be released before switching back to the JVM, e.g.
```
const char* cname = env->GetStringUTFChars(attr_name, nullptr);
TFE_OpSetAttrInt(op, cname, static_cast<int64_t>(value));
env->ReleaseStringUTFChars(attr_name, cname);
```
This bug was only observable for the `Int/Float/Bool/DataType` attributes, others were falling directly into the `SetInAttrValueMap` which was already converting the `StringPiece` into a `string` before adding it into the `AttrValueMap`.

Avoid index out of range in traceable_stack,23388,1,1,1,"Fix for https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow/issues/272 which blocks use of devices in TensorFlow 1.11.

An `list index out of range` exception triggers in [traceable_stack.py#L64](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/traceable_stack.py#L64) which is initialized in [ops.py#L4253](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py#L4253) when running from R:

```
library(tensorflow)
data <- tf$device(""/cpu:0"")
context <- data$`__enter__`()
```

The frame records from `tf_stack.extract_stack()` at [ops.py#L4253](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py#L4253) looks like:

```
<stdin>
/…/r-tensorflow/lib/python3.6/contextlib.py
/…/r-tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py
```

However, while used from R and other tools that embed Python directly, looks like:

```
/…/r-tensorflow/lib/python3.6/contextlib.py
/…/r-tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py
```

Since the Python interpreter is not available when called from R (which embeds Python as a library), `<stdin>` is missing. One fix is to protect against this be reducing the call stack offset when shorter than expected.

Please let us know if you have additional feedback or suggestions to get them implemented, thanks!

Package project,714,137,14,79,"Hello! This turned into a bit of an essay, sorry :)

This PR fixes #708, and is mostly meant to give the maintainers of this project an idea of what we are doing on our end. We realize that this may prove too disruptive to the project as a whole, especially in such a short time, but think that this is the right direction to take it in the long run.

The intention of this PR is to move the project toward a proper Python package, which was the only way my group and I could find to make #309 possible. It does the following:

* Move all files into a single top-level directory called `thealgorithms` (529dc79)
    - Also adds `__init__.py` files to all directories (some already had them), making them Python packages/subpackages
    - This is responsible for the 300+ file changes, you will find that all but a handful of pre-existing files have just been moved
* Add a test that finds all modules in `thealgorithms` and tries to import them (5fb67c2)
    - Note that this fails, see #710 
* Add a setup.py file such that the package can be installed, along with currently known dependencies (ebbb816)
    - This also allows Travis to run tests on the whole package
    - Note that `setup.py` currently requires Python 2.7 or 3.6+ to install. This is easily tuned by changing `python_requires` in `setup.py`.
* Update the `.travis.yml` file to run every test in the `tests` directory.
* Minimal changes to one of the graph algorithms just to pass Flake8 (had undefined names) (e7d121b)

Gathering everything in a package like this sacrifices some accessibility for absolute beginners, but has many benefits in our eyes. It allows for unified testing of the whole project in CI, making it much easier for maintainers to quickly check the quality of pull requests. Given that the project is well over 10000 lines of code by now, maintainability is important. It also makes the more complicated and dependency-heavy parts of the library easier to use, as the `setup.py` file allows one to install the whole package with dependencies using pip. Instructions for how to install should reasonably be added to `README.md`, but we kept it in `setup.py` for now.

Note that, as a package, this is currently broken. Some parts support Python 3 only, some parts Python 2 only, and a few parts successfully support both. Only about 2/3 of the modules can be imported ""properly"" from the root of the project (and thus, from the package) at this time. For the reasons mentioned in #710, my group and I will primarily work on getting Python 3 support up and running, and migrating any existing tests into the `tests` directory. Our goal is to have every module be importable on a package, and having at least some functional tests running on Travis, by Tuesday next week.",4,4,2019-02-22T21:07:45Z,2019-04-30T16:13:58Z,,2778,66 days 19:06:13

Centralized tests for sorting algorithms,723,514,64,89,"@poyea We bit off a bit more than we could chew, but we managed to finish parts of the unified test suite. I will try to bring it in bite-sized chunks, starting with this, if there is interest from your part. Our whole set of changes was a whopping 3800+/1400- lines.

This PR builds on #714, and the comments there are still applicable here. Additionally, this PR adds:

### Tests
* The import tests (just testing to import every module) have been removed to focus on the sorting part only (939c299)
* Generic tests for out-of-place sorting algorithms (7edc521)
    - These tests are parameterized by function name. Any sorting function that just takes a collection can be added to the test suite bu adding it to the `SORTS` list.
* Generic tests for in-place sorting algorithms (e4f9103)
    - Same case as above, in-place sorting algorithms can be tested by adding them to the `SORTS` list.
* Tests for bogosort (e5c68a8)
    - Since bogosort is non-deterministic, running it on large lists is... inadvisable.

### Bugfixes
* Fix for bucket_sort crash on empty input (bd61f06)
* Fix for timsort crash empty input (a9f9069)
* FIx for merge_sort_fastest destroying the input list (2e382d0)
    - On a side note, this merge sort is O(n^2), not O(n) as it claims, because of the removals from the original list.
* Fix for a rare edge case in comb_sort (1b7a82d)
* Fix for tree_sort discarding duplicate elements (b46d67a)
* Some minor fixes in files to make them importable from the root of the project

### Broken algorithms
* timsort
    - There are some edge-cases where timsort fails to sort properly, We don't know why.
* radix_sort
    - Fails most tests, it appears that it cannot handle negative numbers (at the very least, may be more problems).

"Add ""add"" and ""subtract"" func to return valid calc",28915,108,32,9,"Fixes #28792

Add the two Sass functions (`add()`, `subtract()`) to return a valid `calc`. These functions basically return a calc expression, but if one value is 0 the functions return another value.

e.g.
```scss
div {
  padding: add(1rem, 1px);  // calc(1rem + 1px)
  padding: add(1rem, 0);    // 1rem
}
```

The each functions has the third argument (boolean). If `true`, the expression is returned with wrapped by `calc`, but if `false`, the expression is not wrapped with `calc`. The default is `true`. This option is intended for use in complex nested expressions:

e.g.
```scss
div {
  padding: add(1rem, add(1em, 1px));         // calc(1rem + calc(1em + 1px)) : invalid in IE
  padding: add(1rem, add(1em, 1px, false));  // calc(1rem + 1em + 1px) : valid in IE
}
```

Remove the card columns in favor of a Masonry grid,28922,132,124,12,"Mentioned before in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/28891#issuecomment-500917538 and https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/28076#issuecomment-488386892, we should ditch the card columns in favor of masonry.

Main reasons are:

- Cards are ordered per column instead of per row (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17709, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17805, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17882)
- Several rendering issues (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/19060, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/19600, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/19725, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20161, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/28921)
- No control over responsive number of columns (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17511, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/22136,  https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20321, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20905)

I've updated the docs and included Masonry via cdnjs, @XhmikosR is that ok for you, or do you have another proposal? (I also watched the releases of masonry github repo so I know when to upgrade) 

**Edit:**
The demo is a example page now. It's also possible to add additional parameters (`async` & `intergrity`) to the extra js.

TODO:
- [x] Link to this PR in migration section
- [x] Move documentation to examples
- [x] Allow to pass `async` attribute
- [x] Check if integrity attribute is present before printing

Ensure button plugin sets/removes active class correctly on page load,28952,120,30,5,"More fundamentally fixes a problem with Bootstrap's ""faked"" toggles, checkboxes, radio buttons ... the fact that the visual presentation can get out of sync with the real value/state of controls if, for instance, autocomplete happened (which would change the underlying value, but not set the correct `active` class). This does a sanity check on page load and makes sure the `active` class is only set if the underlying control is really pressed/checked, and otherwise removes it. This guarantees that they're in sync from the moment the page is loaded, regardless of whether or not a browser did an autocomplete, or even the author forgot to set BOTH the class and the relevant attribute.

Also, removes the now unnecessary `autocomplete=""off""` attributes used to essentially prevent out-of-sync situations from happening (in Firefox, primarily). Now, if Firefox does an autocomplete, this new logic ensures that the `active` class will be correct, no problem.

Use -of-type instead of -child to accommodate hidden inputs,28997,12,12,1,"Hello friends! Long-time listener, first-time caller 📞

This PR changes the selector for resetting rounded corners of `btn` elements in `btn-groups` from `first-child` to `first-of-type` to accommodate hidden inputs in sets of checkboxes or radio buttons.

The [Rails collection_check_box](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper/collection_check_boxes) or [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form#collection-check-boxes) or [Formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic) all add a hidden input either at the beginning or end of a collection of check boxes or radio buttons. This makes implementing groups of checkboxes or radio buttons [as per the documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#checkbox-and-radio-buttons) either painful or slightly ugly. 

[I initially put this PR in the bootstrap-rubygem repo](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem/pull/175)

Differentiate hover state for outline buttons,28999,6,4,1,"The `:hover` state for outline buttons is effectively the same as the `:active` state, so it can be difficult to tell the difference between a button that is hovered over and one that is active - particularly when using eg [checkbox/radio buttons as buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/buttons/#checkbox-and-radio-buttons), which uses the `active` class to show that something is selected.

This change adds `$hover-background` and `$hover-border` as options to the `button-outline-variant` mixin, and gives them default values half-way between than the `$color` and white.

- [x] Clarify and update padding changes to `<ol>` and `<ul>` in Reboot. I added `padding-right` originally by mistake thinking I needed to reset that, but really I only needed `padding-left` redone.
- [x] Add new Icons component to the migration docs (I created these myself to replace the Open Iconic ones we'd been using). More icons are planned to come, but for now it focuses on a handful for our components.
- [x] Clarify migration docs for the changes in apperance and behavior for form components (namely checks and files).
- [x] Add note to migration docs about table changes.
- [x] Fix remaining tables that were lacking `.table`.
- [x] Improve icons component docs with code snippets, design decisions, and usage guidelines.
- [ ] ~~Look into `box-shadow`s support on icons with custom form controls~~
- [x] After #29029 merges, add search form to the docs homepage
- [x] Consider moving sidebar icon to `::before` per https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/29029#issuecomment-511722549 **Done in @XhmikosR's PR**
- [x] Fix color contrast in navbar
- [x] Update icons one more time—add some new ones, rename the class from `.booticon` to `.bi` because it's shorter and comes with fewer jokes, and remove unused styles in docs CSS.
- [x] Make navbar, subnav, and sidebar work on mobile
- [x] Move the icons to includes
- [ ] Move icons outside of content folder
- [ ] Stop inlining the SVGs; we have http/2 so it should be pretty fast anyway
- [ ] Verify if we need to add `role` or `focusable=""false""`
- [ ] Move the nav changes to a separate PR

Explaining some other decisions...

### Tables

Tables saw a redesign to simplify their CSS and overall appearance. I also took the opportunity to remove several lines of custom docs CSS that re-applied the Bootstrap table styles to Markdown tables. Doing so meant rewriting the tables to allow explicit classes, which I was fine to do given we're inconsistent in our Markdown/HTML tables usage.

See https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/28450/files#diff-e923be674b22e7e32a5d742c5a05b3ae, https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/28450/commits/c8d1a0edb5da7bf4c4e4fbe714ec9500e5774c99, and https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/28450/commits/f9f9e45ec8af2344786853d041f2a8b9bbeb5d20.

### Larger form controls

This was intentional, and really only applies to the checks, radios, and switches. They're larger than the default and inconsistently styled ones each OS sees (macOS ones are quite small) and scale now to `font-size` or explicit dimension changes. I'll look into these not working in IE, but I thought my early tests in there showed no problems.

### Icons

Still working on more here, but again, these are custom icons I've made to replace the ones we were using from external libraries. Goal is to have a toolkit focused set at launch to support our components. Maybe more icons can be added after that. In the future, this could be it's own project I suppose.

### Docs design changes

While the intro to this PR covers much of it, the changes here are meant to simplify our docs and accelerate movement around the docs pages. The sidebar has been overhauled to always have all links available to each docs page vs only the ones in the group you're in (e.g., Components). Stylistically, I'm working to simplify the main navbar for usability and improve the page content design with fewer custom styles.

v4/v5: Row columns for responsive card decks and more,29073,237,1,5,"## Overview

Trying to find a new way to do responsive card decks while not locking ourselves into more card classes. My thinking here is we can easily control the column (`.col`) width by the parent with responsive `.row-cols-*` classes, but I don't know how many we need (have 0-5 now).

```html
<!-- Three columns at the medium breakpoint and up -->
<div class=""row row-cols-md-3"">
  <div class=""col"">Column</div>
  <div class=""col"">Column</div>
  <div class=""col"">Column</div> <!-- Wraps to new line here -->
  <div class=""col"">Column</div>
  <div class=""col"">Column</div>
</div>
```

/cc @twbs/css-review 

## How it works

We can add a default number of columns to support (thinking a max of `6`). You can override this if you like, but otherwise we'll loop over it and generate the responsive classes.

Here's a simplified example with out the responsive infixes. [See it in action via Sassmeister.](https://www.sassmeister.com/gist/d816c44c552b20e68a3b86632cd76780)

```scss
$row-columns: 6 !default;

@for $i from 1 through $row-columns {
  .row-cols-#{$i} > [class^=""col""] {
    flex: 0 0 calc(100% / #{$i});
  }
}
```

Aims to fix #28600 

This is a spike for now, and will need to have the CSS moved, but I wanted to see how feasible this could be. Unfortunately the standard `.form-control` needs the small spinner, so we could support a large input but I'm unsure how to handle smaller inputs. An even smaller spinner?

Change media-breakpoint-down implementation,29148,29,21,8,"`media-breakpoint-down()` always used the next breakpoint, so if you want to target viewports smaller than `lg` (992px) you needed to use:

In this PR, I've changed the implementation to use the breakpoint itself. I've also dropped the `media-breakpoint-only()` mixin since we do not use the ""breakpoint zone"" approach [like we did in v3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#responsive-utilities-classes).

Polishing the emoji plugin,8069,32823,2591,7,"Hi everyone 👋, and thank you so much for this kick-ass project! 

The emoji plugin hasn't been updated in about a year, and the emojis that it was supporting were pretty outdated. I spent the afternoon trying to update it, but in the process, I ended up re-writing significant parts of the plugin. Let me know what you think of it.

Here is the (relatively complete) list of changes:
1. **`emoji-data.txt`**: The previous file was very old, and has been replaced by the [current](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/12.0/emoji-test.txt) Emoji spec (Emoji 12, January 2019). This new spec, however, was formatted very differently from the previous one. This led me...
2. **New `update_emoji` script**: ... to rewrite the parsing script in Python (I am more comfortable with Python than Perl). The mechanism is the same, but I added a few things to it.
3. **Keeping up with Emoji 12**: To state the obvious, _a lot_ has changed in the emoji world over the past few years. This means that the current Emoji spec is much more complex than before. 
   - **Redundant Emojis**: Consider, for instance, that the same emoji can be expressed with different code points. To take an extreme example, the emoji ""Woman detective"" can be expressed with four (!) different combinations of unicode symbols. (🕵️‍♀️,🕵‍♀️,🕵️‍♀,🕵‍♀ for the record.) In that kind of case, the Unicode consortium determines that one of these code points is the gold standard (""full-qualified"", in their parlance), and the other not so much (""minimally-qualified"", ""unqualified"", and so on.) I made sure that the script took that into account. Concretely, all the code points are registered in the `$emoji` array, but with a qualification attached to their names if necessary. (`$emoji[woman_detective] $emoji[woman_detective_unqualified] $emoji[woman_detective_unqualified_1] $emoji[woman_detective_unqualified_2]`, in this case.)
   - **Skin tone / Hair style**: Integrating skin tone and hair style is relatively straightforward. One is still able to make custom combinations by hand, but it gets tricky quickly. All the listed combinations on the Unicode spec are here, though. Moreover, I took the liberty of removing some experimental variables that were planning for this feature (`$emoji2`, for instance).
   - **Non-compatible systems**: Not every OS has been updated with the new emojis, so there will be some weird stuff on your screen if you try to display the newest additions. But hopefully, with this integration, Emoji 12 will be available to the torrent of new macOS users who will be coming this fall.
4. **Automated `$emoji_groups`**: Previously, the `$emoji_groups` associative array, the one that triages emojis into groups for the `display_emoji` command, was hand-coded in `emoji.plugin.zsh`. I found it much easier to automate the process, so these groups are now defined in the python script.
   - **Three groups added**: In addition to programmatically define the emoji groups, I added two new ones: flags, hands, and people. But the latter two are pretty massive in size, which defeats the purpose of the `display_emoji <group>` command a little...
    - **Still more work**: There is still work to be done on which groups to define though. The classification until now was OK when the number of emojis was manageable, but with almost 4,000 emojis nowadays, the classification should be re-thought.
   - **But there is more data**: On the plus side, the current Emoji spec classifies everything into groups and subgroups, which means more granularity to classify if we want to.
5. **Gemoji integration**: It was listed a relative priority on the README, and it was relatively easy to do. I downloaded their JSON database, which is now located at `gemoji_db.json`. Every time an emoji is considered by the script, it looks into that database, and if it finds a nickname, an alias that was not already in the spec, it takes it into account (lines 155-158, 184-187 of `update_emoji.py`). Concretely, that means that the same emoji can be accessed through multiple labels: 😋, for instance, is `$emoji[face_savoring_food]` and `$emoji[yum]`.
6. **Country Codes**: Also high on the priority list, adding country codes as aliases for flags. I added them with the help of an external Python library, `country_converter`. It is an annoying library with a lot of logging, but it works well and has almost every flag covered. This, in turn, means that 🇲🇿, for instance, can be accessed through multiple labels: `$emoji_flags[Mozambique] / [MZ] / [MOZ] / [mozambique]`
7. **README**: I updated the README accordingly, although I tried to leave as untouched as possible.

And I think that's it! Tell me what you think.

Updating deprecated SPDX license headers,740,24397,24397,24326,"In the 3.0 release of the SPDX license list the use of just `GPL-x.x` or `GPL-x.x+` was deprecated in favor of specifying `GPL-x.x-only` or `GPL-x.x-or-later`. 

I wrote a script to go through and update the outdated headers:
```
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I % perl -pi -e \
 's/(SPDX-License-Identifier:.*GPL-\d\.\d(?!(-only|-or-later|\+)))/$1-only/g' %

find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I % perl -pi -e \
 's/(SPDX-License-Identifier:.*GPL-\d\.\d)(\+)/$1-or-later/g' %
```

The first regex statement is to replace `GPL-x.x` with `GPL-x.x-only`. It looks for `SPDX-License-Identifier:` followed by 0 or more of any characters except new lines, followed by `GPL-{digit}.{digit}`, and then a negative lookahead to discard the match if it is followed by `-only` or `-or-later` to ignore headers that have already been updated. The matched statement is appended with `-only` by taking the capture group 1 followed by -only with `$1-only`.

The second regex statement is to replace `GPL-x.x+` with `GPL-x.x-or-later`. It looks for `SPDX-License-Identifier:` followed by 0 or more of any characters except new lines, followed by `GPL-{digit}.{digit}+`. The statement is split into 2 capture groups so that the `+` character can be thrown away before appending `-or-later` with  `$1-or-later`.",2,2,2019-10-09T19:41:37Z,2019-10-14T15:20:10Z,,1310,4 days 19:38:33

Correct explorer opening & add ctrl double click support,87490,22,10,3,"This PR fixes #87082 
@isidorn 
This PR consists of:

- Re-introducing [this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/8b91600b08f5d88ba9d79785a7014c67f492629a) commit to respect the element that is passed in, instead of taking the first one from the selection.
- The above change was pushed and reverted by @isidorn as other parts of the code relied on the function catching incorrect opens with the `length === 1` check. The additional changes remedy that.
- Adding a shift-check for MouseEvent in `onDidOpenResource` such that opens are not triggered by shift-click selecting.
- Moving `focus` to be the first index in `setSelection` as `onSelection` always takes the first index, (This could also be changed to be last), as otherwise the first selected file is always the one incorrectly opened, as reported by #87082 
- Only triggering an `open` inside `onSelection` through a single click or double click when there is only one item in the selection, to prevent unnecessary calls.
- Adding the (somewhat hacky) ability to open a file to the side using Ctrl + double click, when you already have other files selected and want to keep the selection.
- This currently opens files to the side in _non-preview_ mode, which may not be wanted. This could be remedied by setting `doubleClick` to false again after `isCtrlDoubleClick` is true

Enhance views service ,87505,317,103,7,"refs https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87461

@sandy081 let me know if this looks on the right path. I ran into an issue with the views service now depending on the panel service and the panel service depending on the views service, both in the constructor. you can see I work around this with the instantiation service but still the panel service needs delay its panel registration call somehow (see setTimeout call in constructor). I don't think this part is quite right so I'm looking for suggestions. Depending on a few things, sometimes I see the outline view rendered twice in the panel when moved during testing so need to iron that out as well. I think it might just be caused by the setTimeout though.

Backend part of working sets,87666,82,4,4,"I see that you have a support for working sets in the roadmap on the next year.

This proposal creates a ""backend"" part for the working sets:
- It creates workingSets.json file in .vscode folders in roots of mounted folder
- It allows defining included folders in these files
- It allows to switch active working set using a setting in workspace

Design decisions:
- The working sets have overlapping scopes, i.e. you can activate the working set with the same name, and it will work in several mounted folders. This is done by design, since often, working sets span several repositories.
- I didn't use anything complicated as include patterns, since I want to have a simple UI, ideally, checkbox tree to choose what's available.

Next steps:
- If it gets accepted, I will create a UI for it. It can be implemented as an extension, or as a part of the main process (which is preferable, since there're more UI features there).

I reviewed the code of the dialog component and found a misleading code. In the switch structure that judges the type of the icon, the icon of the question type is displayed as the info type.

case 'info':

There's a further scenario where `getMultiSelectedResources` will return a wrong resource:

2. The command handler invokes `revealFileInOS`, but providing a uri different from selected file
3. `getMultiSelectedResources` will still return selected file's uri, not the uri desired by the extension.

It enables extensions to provide pre-filled query to settings/keybindings editor, to help users better edit configurations or keybindings related to their extensions.

> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using

Note that *this is simply an idea for a solution, I made some assumptions that may not be true for other users*. I mention these points in the ""Doubts/Talking points"" section of this PR.

### Summary of the feature request
It was requested that when searching for a file (through `Cmd+p` or `Ctrl+p`) it should be possible to go back (and forward) through the inputed filenames (such as is possible in the Atom text editor).

### Overview of the solution
 I added an array to `QuickOpenController` to store the `lastSubmittedInputValue`. The value is stored each time `onOK()` executes.
The array always begins and ends with an empty string `''` so that when the user goes beyond the very first submitted input value, the `QuickOpenWidget` search bar is cleared (same reasoning for when the user goes too far forward in the history).
The `navigateInputHistory` method I added to the `QuickOpenController` is the code that handles navigating the array.

### How to test
To test this out, open a folder with vscode and add a custom keybinding in `User/keybindings.json` similar to:
```json
[
	{
	""key"": ""cmd+z"",
	""command"": ""navigateInputHistory"",
	""when"": ""inQuickOpen"",
	""args"": ""backwardInInputHistory""
	},
	{
	""key"": ""cmd+y"",
	""command"": ""navigateInputHistory"",
	""when"": ""inQuickOpen"",
	""args"": ""forwardInInputHistory""
	}
]
```
You can then: 
* search for a couple of files and hit `enter` to open up each of those files
* go back to searching for files with `Cmd+p`
* hit `Cmd+z` (and later `Cmd+y`) to ensure that the keybindings correctly go back and forth in the list of filenames you previously submitted and hit `enter` with.

### Doubts/Talking points

1. I was not clear on the HistoryInputBox that should have been hooked up to quick open that was mention by @roblourens [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/69843#issuecomment-540254260), this solution is what I came up with in the meanwhile.
2. I tried using this feature in Atom and my understanding is that Atom does something more complex than simply going back through the history of submitted filenames. Is this solution too simple with respect to what Atom does?
3. What about duplicates? That is, if I enter filename ""A"", then hit `enter`, then search for ""A"" again and hit `enter` again. The way this solution is implemented, ""A"" would show up twice in a row in the history which is kind of ugly.
4. I could not get `alt+up/down` to work as a shortcut on my machine, that just kept navigating me through the list of found files.
5. Should this be a default shortcut? ",2,2,2020-01-08T20:53:02Z,2020-03-20T17:36:24Z,,2656,71 days 20:43:22

fix(debug): don't insert task boundaries between events,88459,121,33,2,"See discussion in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/206.

This PR adjusts logic such that we only assert task boundaries around
requests and responses, rather than around every single event. I believe
this will solve the primary case where misordering can happen, as given
in the existing unit test and described more verbosely in the doc
comment in this PR.

A more conservative approach would be to only omit the boundary between
events of the same type. That would be safer, but I browsing through
the code I didn't see any cases where it looked like we could get
tripped up by bucketing here (e.g. cases where we resolve a deferred
promise in an event handler).

Seems to fix the performance issue for me.

This PR fixes the usage of the `monaco-editor-core` in shadowDOM (see this issue to get more details - https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/308). 
This request is based on some changes proposed in https://github.com/paulvarache/monaco-editor-element. 

This PR assumes that, when the monaco-editor-core runs in a shadow DOM, the shadow root should be assigned to `window.monacoShadowRoot`. It is a workaround to make it visible in all the classes/helpers that deal with the DOM (e.g. dom.ts). I would like to know how can we attach it to a Monaco instance instead of having it global.

Lastly, since some browsers do not implement all the functions needed for the ShadowDOM, I had to add some polyfills. They were added to `editorDom.ts` (I am not sure if it's the most suitable place)

I notice that panel headers do not have the same context menu luxuries that the viewlet has due to the composite bar and view headers being a combined concept for panel.

Notes from implementation:
1) It seems the view descriptor service should be responsible for generating the view containers when a view is moved to the panel without a destination. this is important because of the next point.

Update: Moved logic into the service and moved service to its own filed due to cyclic dependency issue.

2) when a view is moved to the panel and then the window is reloaded, the view descriptor service needs to be able to create the cached view container at the point of the views registration because the container was created on the fly previously.

3) the cache may need to be enhanced to store that a cached view container was auto-generated and not registered the traditional way as well as the location info about that view container so it can be recreated.

Update: the cache now stores the id of the container along with its source view id and location if it is auto generated.

4) these on-the-fly view containers should not be too custom to the view that created them because it is possible in the future that a view is moved to the panel to create container A. another view is moved to container A. the first view is moved back to the sidebar leaving the second view in container A. On reload, we need to be able to recreate container A preferably without too much knowledge about the view that created it since we don't have that information anymore.

Update: by using the source view id to regenerate the id, we assume that the source view will be registered at some point. if it is not, we move the pending view back to its default location. this is the same logic as containers contributed by extensions.

Add experimental prepareForHotExit method for custom editors,88948,118,6,6,"For  #88719 

Adds an experimental `prepareForHotExit` method to the custom editor API proposal. This method allows custom editors to hook in to VS Code's hot exit behavior

If `prepareForHotExit` is not implemented, VS Code will assume that the custom editor cannot be hot exited.

If `prepareForHotExit` is implemented, VS Code will invoke the method after every edit (this is debounced). At this point, this extension should back up the current resource.  The result is a promise indicating if the backup was successful or not

VS Code will only hot exit if all backups were successful.

This is only a first draft of the potential API. I'm working on testing this with the example custom editor extensions. Some open questions:

- Does `prepareForHotExit` provide enough for extensions to impement hot exit?
- How do we notify extensions that they can get rid of their old backups (such as when the user enables auto save)
- Does this work properly on both web and desktop?

Just a trivial change to set the default of the 'html.mirrorCursorOnMatchingTag' setting to false, seems since the default setting of this was true, it seems counter-intuitive in certain cases.

A simple test would be to build and run a version of the editor, and by default expect this setting to be false.

## Implementation notes

At this moment, I simply re-used the theme variables for regular scrollbar sliders as the thingy really looks a lot like a scrollbar slider. However, I am not opposed to the idea of introducing a completely new colour customisation variable for it.

Also note that after second thought I feel I _should_ somehow use `registerThemingParticipant()` in the `git` builtin package to get this working, but I'll let you guide me first before I venture forth. ❤️

Fixes #32264 - Allow N instances of the same task,89872,101,12,7,"# Summary
* These changes allow N instances of the same task to be run simultaneously.
* The maximum number of allowable instances can be set in `RunOptions`.
* The instances of a task are visible in the QuickPick with an ` (i)` appended to the quick pick entry label to indicate that the task is an instance of an already running task. 
For example if 3 instances of task `foo` are running, the QuickPick would display:
```
foo
foo (1)
foo (2)
```
# Implementation notes
## Distinguishing between multiple instances of the same task
When a task is run in `terminalTaskSystem`, if another instance can be created, the task that the user selected is cloned and its `id` is modified to have form `<ORIGINAL_TASK_ID>|<COUNTER>`.
The counter gets incremented each time an instance of the same task is created. The cloned task is then run like any other task.
This makes it possible to check if a task is an instance of another task because all instances of a task will have the `<ORIGINAL_TASK_ID>` substring in common in their respective ids.
## Tracking multiple instances of the same task.
The `<ORIGINAL_TASK_ID>` substring shared by all instances serves as the key in a dictionary where the value is an `InstanceManager` object that stores information related to all instances of a task such as the number of currently active instances.

## How to test changes
Create a `tasks.json` and set the `instances` property. Here is an example configuration:
```json
{
    ""version"": ""2.0.0"",
    ""tasks"": [
        {
            ""label"": ""echo"",
            ""type"": ""shell"",
            ""command"": ""sleep 20 && echo Hello"",
            ""runOptions"": { ""instances"": 3}
        }
    ]
}
```
You can then execute the `echo` task, ensure that it never runs more than 3 instances of itself and that if a 4th instance is attempted, you should be prompted to either terminate or restart **the last instance** of `echo`.

simple file dialog - add files to recently opened,89994,20,5,2,"@alexr00 I noticed that whenever the simple file dialog is used (e.g in remote or even in web), picked files are not showing up in this files section of the recently opened list:

Suggested fix is to let the simple file dialog add the history entry for files picked. Let me know if you think it should be at a different place altogether.

Separate shared process ipc (client) ready and server ready,90136,52,16,3,"Issue:

Currently main is waiting to register its services, until the shared process is ready and initialised. This is an issue if services in shared process need to request main during initialisation. Eg: Storage service initialisation on shared process.

Given this scenario where main as server and shared process as client, server can wait until the client connection is established to register its channels.

This PR introduces a new barrier `whenIpcReady` that is released when shared process ipc (client) is ready and thereafter server (main) can register its channels. Those who are clients to shared process should keep continue to wait `whenReady` that is when shared process is ready and initialised.

Fixes #49027.

The first line of code is too close to the top of the editor (tab list, breadcrumbs) and can be visually displeasing at times, especially in themes where the background colors contrast.

I implemented two new options, `editor.padding.top` and `editor.padding.bottom`, which adds the specified amount of fixed whitespace above the first line and below the last line. This means the padding will move as you scroll (i.e. it's not ""sticky"").

Because the LinesLayout already handles whitespace around lines in a practically identical fashion, I placed this functionality in there. 

Example with `editor.padding.top` set to 25:

This PR fixes #90305 by adding a command `filesExplorer.openFileDontPreserveFocus`. It is largely based on commit  079aef1ec5549171717decf30a9cb3e5b8aeee18, which added the command `filesExplorer.openFilePreserveFocus`.

The PR refactors the logic for opening a file (or set of files) from the explorer into a helper method, which is then invoked with a `preserveFocus` parameter in `filesExplorer.openFile[Dont]PreserveFocus`. It then exposes the second command, with no default key. If you think there should be a default key, I'd be happy to add that.

I validated this change by creating a custom keybinding in my dev version of VSCode that invoked both commands, and confirmed that for `openFilePreserveFocus` the functionality was unchanged from stock VSCode and that for `openFileDontPreserveFocus` the file that was opened was focused, and when multiple files were selected the first selected was the one focused - which seems like reasonable default behavior to me.",3,2,2020-02-08T22:03:42Z,2020-02-10T18:42:13Z,,1336,1 days 20:38:31

I noticed that DX of `peekview-widget` could be improved.

While on the left side we have the file name (same as the tab name) which is not clickable but important for accessibility purposes. See the picture below.

Exposed Open/Save dialog title on public VSCode Proposed API,90493,35,2,3,"This PR fixes #82871.
Now open/save dialog title is exposed on public VSCode Proposed API.

I've tested on Ubuntu 19.10 with an extension which invokes showSaveDialog() and showOpenDialog() methods. Here's an usage example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10179520/74287780-86cf5300-4d09-11ea-9abe-3f081ef763e3.png)

The example below shows _My open title_ on the top of Open Dialog.

**Note:** on this version of Ubuntu the _Save Dialog_ title is not shown, but it's an OS-related behaviour.
Every save dialog of VSCode running on Ubuntu 19.10 ignores the specified title as can be seen on 'File -> Save Workspace As...' (On Windows it shows 'Save Workspace' but on Ubuntu no title is shown).",4,3,2020-02-11T23:15:44Z,2020-02-19T14:38:45Z,2020-02-19T14:38:45Z,837,7 days 15:23:01

closer to what the original `sinon.stub()` method does.

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

During file downloads, youtube-dl or the external downloaders that it invokes may leak cookies on HTTP redirects to a different host, or leak them when the host for download fragments differs from their parent manifest's host.

This PR implements various remediations to avoid this behaviour:
* removing the Cookie header upon HTTP redirects
* having native downloaders calculate their own Cookie header from the Cookiejar
* using each external downloader's built-in support for cookies, instead of passing them as header arguments; or if the external downloader does not have proper cookie support, disabling HTTP redirection (axel only)
* processing cookies passed as HTTP headers to limit their scope (`--add-header ""Cookie:...""` is scoped to input URL domain only)
* storing cookies in a separate cookies field of the info dict instead of http_headers so as not to lose their scope.

These remediations match similar ones committed to yt-dlp:

### Description of your *pull request* and other information

This PR encapsulates various under-the-hood fixes, improvements and tests.
* Process `Content-Encoding`s according to [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110):
  - support nested encodings
  - support `br` encoding, if _Brotli_ package is installed (`pip install brotli`, [""Only Python 2.7+ is supported.""](https://github.com/google/brotli/blob/master/python/README.md) -- Only?)
  - support 'compress' encoding, if _ncompress_ package is installed (`pip install ncompress`, ""Requires: Python >=3.8"")
  - change: the response `Content-Encoding` header has only unprocessed encodings, or is removed if all encodings were decoded
  - change: the value in the `Content-Length` header is the decoded length
  - `zlib` is used for both deflate and gzip decompression (except for Jython which doesn't support this in 2.7.1 for reasons not investigated)
  - some elements taken from https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/7094: thx @coletdjnz.
* Rework URL path munging for ., .. components ( https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/3355):
  - revise e8de54b as part of `utils.YoutubeDLHandler`
  - using this, also process `Location` header for redirects
  - use the static (test_utils) and network (test_http) tests from yt-dlp/yt-dlp#7662.",0,2,2023-07-28T11:35:29Z,2023-07-29T13:27:26Z,2023-07-29T13:27:26Z,3020,1 days 01:51:57

After merging #32481, one [further change](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/pull/32481#discussion_r1278527838) was needed. Meanwhile new _flake8_ Linter rules appeared. This PR addresses both.

To pass new Linter rules, direct comparison to `type`s is reworked and at the same time `isinstance()` tests (especially for str/unicode/bytes) are revised, avoiding actual Python version tests as far as possible",0,1,2023-07-31T19:03:02Z,2023-08-01T00:05:10Z,2023-08-01T00:05:10Z,2152,0 days 05:02:08
